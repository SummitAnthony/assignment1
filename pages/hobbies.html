    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I love immersing myself in activities that not only bring joy but also help me grow personally and professionally. Here are a few of my favorite hobbies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Coding:</strong> I'm passionate about coding, especially working on side projects and exploring new programming languages. I enjoy participating in online coding challenges and building small projects to improve my skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Tech Articles:</strong> Staying updated with the latest trends in technology is important to me. I regularly read articles on AI advancements, software development, and finance technology to stay in the loop.</li>
      <li><strong>Hackathons:</strong> I love the thrill of hackathons! Working under pressure to build something innovative with a team sharpens my problem-solving and teamwork skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Apart from tech, I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy novels. Itâ€™s a way for me to relax and get inspired by other worlds and ideas.</li>
      <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Exploring new cultures and meeting new people is something I cherish. Each place I visit offers new experiences and perspectives that broaden my outlook.</li>
    </ul>
